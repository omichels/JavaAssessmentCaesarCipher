# JavaAssessmentCaesarCipher


this is a very simple assessment test for a junior java developer.

the task is to create an implementation of the caesar cipher,
that means shifting the clear text 3 chars in the alphabet to the right.
=> character "a" becomes a "D"

Also the clear text should be converted to upper-case and at the end
of the alphabet it has to wrap around, so to start at the "A".

the class EncryptServiceTest is a JUnit Class for following the
TDD style, with it you can test your implementation

this is repository contains all necessary files for being imported
as an eclipse project
