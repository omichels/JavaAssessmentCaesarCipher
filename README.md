# JavaAssessmentCaesarCipher


this is a very simple assessment test for a junior java developer.

the task is to create an implementation of the caesar cipher,  
that means shifting the clear text 3 chars in the alphabet to the right.  
=> character "A" becomes a "D"

Also the clear text should be converted to upper-case.  
=> character "a" becomes a "D"

At the end of the alphabet it has to wrap around starting with the "A".

the class EncryptServiceTest is a JUnit Class for following the  
TDD style, with it you can test your implementation.

this repository contains all necessary files for being imported  
as an eclipse project.
